This interactive dashboard offers users a chance to explore the behaviour of different machine learning models trained on the dry bean dataset, a popular dataset for machine learning model benchmarking and testing. The dataset can be accessed on the UCI machine learning repository [1]. More details on bean classes, and the creation of the dataset, including how the features in the dataset were extracted from photographs of beans used in machine imaging techniques, can be found in the paper [2].
